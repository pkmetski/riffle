        //   * ProcessLifecycleOwner ON_START — heals doze/wake drift on Android 13+ where
        //     NetworkCallback events can be dropped or coalesced. `activeNetwork` is the coarse
        //     ground-truth: null → offline, non-null → union any newly-qualifying networks in.
        //     The sweep never removes networks the callbacks have already reported, so a stale
        //     `getAllNetworks()` during teardown cannot revert a correct offline emit.
        //   * Foreground poll ticker — every POLL_INTERVAL_MS re-emits with the tracker's current
        //     state cross-checked against a FRESH `activeNetwork` read. This closes the
        //     Android 13 gap where the OS drops the `onLost` for a network going away entirely
        //     (airplane on, network vanishes) so no callback ever fires and neither the
        //     `activeNetwork == null` veto nor the ON_START sweep can rescue us until the user
        //     backgrounds+foregrounds the process or navigates enough to force a fresh
        //     ViewModel-driven refresh. The tick is READ-ONLY against the tracker — it never
        //     merges, never clears — so it cannot re-add a stale network the way the removed
        //     PR #392 `syncNow()` could. It only lets the `activeNetwork == null` veto fire on a
        //     bounded schedule instead of exclusively piggybacking on callback events.
        //
        // "Qualifying" here means `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` only — we deliberately do NOT require
        // `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED`. That flag is set by Android's built-in probe to
        // `connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204`, which is unreachable on Huawei devices
        // without GMS and on any network that firewalls Google endpoints. Riffle never talks to
        // Google — it talks to the user's Audiobookshelf server, WebDAV, and optional Storyteller
        // peer — so making the banner depend on a Google reachability probe misreports offline for
        // every affected user. See `isQualifyingNetwork` below.
        //
        // Tradeoff: on a network where INTERNET is set but the server is actually unreachable
        // (captive portal that hasn't been signed into, away-from-LAN with a LAN-only server),
        // `isOnline` will now report true. On the main library screens the shim is
        // `LibraryItemsViewModel._refreshFailed` (and the analogous `_refreshFailed` in
        // `SeriesDetailViewModel` / `CollectionDetailViewModel`), which flips the banner when a
        // library refresh returns `NetworkError`. Other consumers of `isOnline` —
        // `LibraryItemDetailViewModel`, `FilteredBooksViewModel`, `ReadaloudSession`'s
        // download-prompt guard — do NOT have this shim, so on unvalidated-server-unreachable
        // networks they will show the online state and fail at request time. That is a strictly
        // narrower failure mode than the Huawei bug (which broke the primary use case entirely)

 *   * `(true, false)` — the fourth-time-around regression: on Android 13 the OS silently drops
 *     one of the `onLost` callbacks when airplane mode turns multiple qualifying networks off at
 *     once, so the tracker retains a stale network and thinks we're online. `activeNetwork ==
 *     null` vetoes it → offline.
 *   * `(false, true)` — the airplane-mode/#294 regression: during teardown `activeNetwork` can
 *     still briefly report the just-lost network. The tracker (driven by `onLost`) is correct
 *     → offline.
 *   * `(true, true)` — healthy online state.
 *   * `(false, false)` — clean disconnect, both signals agree → offline.
